# Summary
The video lists 5 Tools I like using when coding.
The applications are:
1. Beyond Compare 4: https://www.scootersoftware.com/
2. Rider: https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/
3. Obsidian: https://obsidian.md/
4. Github Desktop: https://desktop.github.com/
5. Screen To GIF: https://www.screentogif.com/

# Mistakes
1. LFS - Large File System is spoken. Large File Storage is what I meant. Corrected with text.

# Weak Points
1. Github in Rider. I say "Github built in" as though it is a point against Visual Studio when it's only meant as a point for Rider and how much more user friendly Rider's implementation appears to be. This might be user preference but the Git implementation in Visual Studio does not offer for me anything over Github desktop which Rider does with how good Rider's Comparison and validation is.
2. Beyond Compare. I don't properly explain why folder compare on BC4 just that it is better. The better point might be to spend a little more time comparing the interface, and maybe comparing the space comparison (among other features).
3. Screen To GIF. Probably the weakest piece of software in this video even though I do really like it and stand by the points. Due to the title 'for Software Engineering' and this isn't for the Engineering it's more for communication around the position.

# Video Improvements
1. Manual Focus. The camera continually zooms in and it is distracting. It also means the blue screen elements sometimes glitch.
2. Manual Colour / turn off Low Light Mode. The colour of the scene continually changes through out the video.
3. Yellow. Yellow is not a great colour. It looked fine in person and in the images, but not on video. The pens are all fine.
4. Blue/Green screens. These are fine and I'm glad to have proved them out but I'm thinking we need either bigger ones or to simply not use them and to use printouts. Keep it in the Tool Box though.
5. Music. Might be nice to find some better music in future.

# Video Good Points
1. Proved the setup. The two light, one camera setup appears to work and give the result we were hoping for. The cutting board is a nice touch to give place in the scene also.
2. Proved the Green/Blue Screen. This can be used if the opportunity is such that it makes sense.

# Elements for Next Time
1. Switch out the camera. Consider switching the camera for a phone camera might give a better quality.
2. Manual and Printouts. Let's prove out Printouts at some point in the Future.
3. No recording after. This was recorded with the video after each segment then overlaid. Let us attempt talking as we do it next time or a time in the future.
