# Summary
This is the process for handling errors in videos, it contains what should happen when found and how to find them.

---
# Error Types
These describe the types of errors but not the severity of the errors. Types
## Incorrect Names
Naming a technology or item incorrectly. **This does not apply to people or their pro-nouns**.
## Incorrect Person Identification
Naming a person incorrectly by giving the wrong name or title to that person. **This does not apply to personal pro-nouns**.
## Incorrect Pro-noun of a Person in the Present
Providing a pro-noun of a person which is incorrect at the time of publication of the video, or recording of the video if the video is obviously and identifiably shot in a different time.

An example of the latter is during the Pandemic TV Shows would continually need to remind the audience that the show they were watching was not filmed during 2020 social distancing.

**In the present of the content** will be treated differently than looking back on the content.
## Portrayal of or suggestion to incorrect procedure
Providing instructions, suggesting methods or actually performing something which is not advised or runs contrary to ethical concerns.

For instance, using scissors to cut a box, slicing toward the hand and body.
## Incorrect or misleading citations
Providing citations which are either incorrect or suggesting a citation is for a particular fact and being mistaken.
## Stating a lie which is non-obvious as to it's sarcasm
Sarcasm although a form of comedy may run into issue in which it is taken seriously and incorrect information is portrayed as fact.

# Error Mediums
Mediums errors may come across to the viewer. These error mediums may occur for videos, games and social media although for this document video and social media is the focus.
## Spoken
Errors spoken by someone in the video which contain something in-correct.
## Visual
The actor visually performs an incorrect behaviour or a visual effect is used.
## Editing
An edit such as an annotation or the ability to cut clips together causes an error.
## Written
In the video description, pinned comment, GitHub, Obsidian Vault, Online and blog, a written in words error.
## Communication
Social media online, in person communication at an event, on a podcast or as a guest within a video. General communication which may occur outside of the walls of the content produced and managed by PassonOnSale.

# Error Reactions
These are the reactions or methods which may be used to correct errors.
## Removal
Removing a video, post, podcast or other medium. This is the most destructive of the reactions as it does not have a technique for further usage.
## Replacement
Taking down or editing an error within the type and replacing it with a version without the containing error in.
## Annotation
If the error is caught say on video before release, an annotation may be added upon editing which corrects the mistake without a re-shoot.

Technically you may annotate in two ways
### Text Annotation
Add text onto the screen, often with an asterisk * which points out the correct answer.
### Voice Annotation
Play clip of your voice in place of the incorrect speech. This rarely if ever sounds correct or seamless.

Occasionally channels will combine text and voice placing text over the mouth. At the least if voice is used text should also be used for clarity.
## Re-shoot, re-write or re-start of production
Remove (or do not release) the original content and reproduce the section (and further sections) of the process reducing the number of errors.
## Respond
If the error was outward facing and requires notification for the audience, responding to the error via social media or pinned comment is sometimes a good strategy.
## Apologise
Some errors may not be removed by other techniques and the community should be the focus in these cases. If applicable, a video, post or other such medium may be used to apologise for an error.

# Procedures for errors
These are the procedures for handling errors.
## Death by a thousand knives
If a piece of content contains too many errors then removal and if possible replacement is the only technique. 

If the content is new re-shoot may also be an option.

This rule is added purely to state that containing too many errors does not make each separate error 'fixed' and therefore the video 'fixed'.
## Incorrect Names
Name a product or technology incorrectly.
Answer these questions:
1. Is the name vital to the subject of the video?
2. Would someone believe the incorrect name after searching the incorrect name and a few keywords?
3. Is there so little context around the word they could not get these keywords?

If you answered **yes** to any of these then a *voice annotation* is best.

If you did not answer **yes** then a *text annotation* should be fine in most cases. Where the incorrect element becomes prominent consider switching the first answer to yes.
